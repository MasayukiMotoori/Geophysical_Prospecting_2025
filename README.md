### Abstract
Time-domain electromagnetics (TEM) is sensitive to variations in resistivity and chargeability, which are diagnostic physical properties of seafloor hydrothermal deposits. Several surveys using the Waseda Integrated Seafloor Time-domain Electromagnetic exploration system (WISTEM) have been conducted. One of the collected data contains negative transients, attributed to induced polarization (IP) effects, which have been observed over known deposits in the Okinawa Trough, Japan (2018).

The Cole–Cole type model is a common parameterization of complex resistivity due to IP effects; however, it implicitly assumes a wide frequency band, which is not necessarily covered by the frequency band of the TEM response if the time range is limited. We show a synthetic study that TEM inversion using the Cole–Cole model suffers from significant instability, which we attribute to the discrepancy between the model’s assumed frequency band and the frequency band of the data.

The Debye Decomposition model provides a way to bridge this gap by allowing explicit selection of the relaxation time band over which the influence of chargeability in the data behaves distinctly from the influence of resistivity. Using a synthetic example, we demonstrate how the Debye Decomposition model allows us to reconcile the inversion results with the wide-band spectral IP (SIP) response of the true target layer. Namely, we show that by fitting a Debye Decomposition model to the SIP response using a limited relaxation time band that is consistent with the frequency band of the TEM data, the recovered IP parameters are consistent between the TEM and SIP data. We also present a field application, and show that the method recovers reasonable and interpretable IP parameters for seafloor hydrothermal deposits.
